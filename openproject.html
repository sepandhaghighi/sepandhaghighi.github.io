    <h2>Nafas: Breathing Gymnastics Application</h2>
        <p>Breathing gymnastics is a system of breathing exercises that focuses on the treatment of various diseases and general health promotion. Nafas is a collection of breathing gymnastics designed to reduce the exhaustion of long working hours. With multiple breathing patterns, Nafas helps you find your way to a detoxified energetic workday and also improves your concentration by increasing the oxygen level. No need to walk away to take a break, just sit comfortably, run Nafas and let the journey begin. Nafas means breath in Persian.</p>

    <h2>OPEM: Open Source PEM Fuel Cell Simulation Tool (<a href="http://opem.ecsim.ir">opem.ecsim.ir</a>)</h2>
        <p align="justify">Modeling and simulation of proton-exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) may work as a powerful tool in the research & development of renewable energy sources. The Open-Source PEMFC Simulation Tool (OPEM) is a modeling tool for evaluating the performance of proton exchange membrane fuel cells. This package is a combination of models (static/dynamic) that predict the optimum operating parameters of PEMFC. OPEM contained generic models that will accept as input, not only values of the operating variables such as anode and cathode feed gas, pressure and compositions, cell temperature and current density, but also cell parameters including the active area and membrane thickness. In addition, some of the different models of PEMFC that have been proposed in the OPEM, just focus on one particular FC stack, and some others take into account a part or all auxiliaries such as reformers. OPEM is a platform for collaborative development of PEMFC models.</p>

    <h2>Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) Fuel Cell Dataset</h2>
        <p align="justify">This dataset are about Nafion 112 membrane standard tests and MEA activation tests of PEM fuel cell in various operation condition. Dataset include two general electrochemical analysis method, Polarization and Impedance curves. In this dataset, effect of different pressure of H2/O2 gas, different voltages and various humidity conditions in several steps are considered. Behavior of PEM fuel cell during distinct operation condition tests, activation procedure and different operation condition before and after activation analysis can be concluded from data. In Polarization curves, voltage and power density change as a function of flows of H2/O2 and relative humidity. Resistance of the used equivalent circuit of fuel cell can be calculated from Impedance data. Thus, experimental response of the cell is obvious in the presented data, which is useful in depth analysis, simulation and material performance investigation in PEM fuel cell researches.</p>

    <h2>Single DBFC Dataset</h2>
        <p align="justify">This dataset includes Direct Borohydride Fuel Cell (DBFC) impedance and polarization test in anode with Pd/C, Pt/C and Pd decorated Niâ€“Co/rGO catalysts. In fact, different concentration of Sodium Borohydride (SBH), applied voltages and various anode catalysts loading with explanation of experimental details of electrochemical analysis are considered in data. Voltage, power density and resistance of DBFC change as a function of weight percent of SBH (%), applied voltage and amount of anode catalyst loading that are evaluated by polarization and impedance curves with using appropriate equivalent circuit of fuel cell. Can be stated that interpretation of electrochemical behavior changes by the data of related cell is inevitable, which can be useful in simulation, power source investigation and depth analysis in DB fuel cell researches.</p>
